% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual

% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.

% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).

% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} paper deals with the problem of imbalanced datasets. \\
Often times the dataset that are used for classification have data points of ``interesting" class as a minority. \\
This skews the classification in favor of majority class samples.\\
In many cases, the penalty for mis-classifying these minority classes are much higher than mis-classifying the majority ``normal" class.\\
Examples: pictures of mammograms for cancerous cell detection (98\%-2\%).\\
The paper proposes a new algorithm to augment the datasets by creating synthetic data points for minority class to even the data distribution.\\
Thus, leading to creation of better classifiers with near equal representation from all class in training data.\\
Evaluation criteria of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) provides trade-off between true positive (TP) vs. false positive (FP).\\
Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC curve is an accepted metric for classification performance. 

Many previous work tries to tackle the problem of imbalanced datasets in broadly two ways.\\
First, to assign distinct penalty for training data and \\
Second, to change the dataset by either under-sampling the majority class or over-sampling the minority class.\\
The authors approach mixes the two and uses a unique algorithm to over-sample the minority class.\\
They show there performance using the AUC of ROC curve and ROC convex hull method.\\
They compare there classification for C4.5 Decision Tree, Ripper and Naive Bayes classifiers.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

\section{Previous Works}

Most of the cases of imbalanced dataset is dealt in two ways, viz. under-sampling the majority class samples or over-sampling the minority class samples.\\
Different domain requires different techniques for the same based on their requirement. \\
When it comes to under-sampling the majority class, Kubat et al (1997, 1998) experimented with the same.\\
In Kubat and Matwin (1997), the majority class is selectively under sampled while the minority class sampling remains fixed. \\
The performance metric used for the classifier is geometric mean which is not as expressive as a ROC curve and corresponds to just one point on it.\\
Related to the above, the SHRINK system of Kubat et al (1998) classified the overlapping reasons of both majority and minority classes as positive, leading to a "best positive region" classification.
 
Another study on under-sampling of dataset was performed by Japkowicz (2000). \\
In her study, she explored different sampling techniques on artificial 1D data for better evaluation of concept complexity.\\
Her exploration involved under-sampling as well as resampling of data.\\
Both strategies involved two different methods, viz. random and focused. \\
Random resampling used samples from minor class to be sampled randomly until they matched major class samples, while focused resampling used only the boundary points between minor and major class.\\
In random under-sampling, the samples from majority class were removed randomly to match the minority class samples, in contrast to focused under-sampling which under sampled majority class samples lying further away.\\
Her study revealed the efficacy of both the sampling techniques but did not provide any clear advantage in the domain considered.

While under sampling approach works, other works uses under-sampling of majority class samples along with over-sampling of minority class samples for learning a better classifier.\\
Ling and Li et al (1998) uses lift analysis to measure classifier's performance in the domain of marketing analysis problem.\\
They ranked the test examples by confidence measures and used lift as the evaluation criteria.\\
In one of the experiments they performed, they under sampled the majority class and observed that the best lift index is obtained when there is equal representation of the classes.\\
In another experiment, they over-sampled the minority samples with replacement to match the negative samples but could not prove the same as significant. \\
The work present in this paper is similar in strategy, but the over-sampling techniques is different.\\
Another work which uses the idea of under-sampling as well as over-sampling of data to overcome class imbalance problem is Solberg and Solberg et al (1996).\\
They use SAR imagery dataset obtained for classification of oil slicks which is heavily biased towards look-alike data compared to oil slicks (98\%-2\%). \\
They created a new dataset by over-sampling the oil slicks data randomly and under-sampling the look-alike data to create equal class distribution.\\
As a result, on learning a classification tree on the balanced dataset they obtained better error rates on both classes compared to training on imbalanced dataset.\\
Domingos et al (1999) also take the same approach to deal with class imbalance by introducing a "metacost" term to under-sampling as well as over-sampling.\\
The work shows the metacost improves over either, and proves that under-sampling of majority class does better than over-sampling of minority class.

Other researchers (DeRouin et al 1991) tried to use the same on feed-forward neural networks which is not able to learn to discriminate between classes sufficiently due to the same class imbalance problem.\\
The learning rate of the neural network was adapted according to the class distribution in the data set.\\
Experimenting over artificial as well as real-world training data with multi-class problem provided better classification accuracy for minority class.\\
In information retrieval domain, document classification is one of the challenging problems which is affected by this class imbalance.\\
Creating  a simple bag-of-words model results in interesting words samples as a minority due to very limited instances of such words in the document.\\
Thus, in IR domain, the performance metric is replaced from error rates and instead, precision and recall terms are used for performance measurements.\\
$$recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$ $$precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$
We will see what we mean by the terms True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) in the next section.
In the same domain, Mladenic and Grobelnik (1999) proposed a feature subset selection approach to deal with class imbalance.\\
They found out that using odd ratio along with Naive Bayes classifier performs best in the domain. \\
Odds ratio incorporates target class information giving better result over information gain which is computed per word for each class.\\
In 1997, Provost and Fawcett introduced the ROC convex hull method for performance evaluation of the classifier in which ROC space is used to separate classification performance from class and cost distribution. 


\section{Evaluation Criteria and Performance Metrics}
Confusion matrix, as shown in Table \ref{tab:confmat}, is one of the most common method in machine learning used to evaluate performance of a (2-class) classification problem.\\

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|}
    	\hline
         & Predicted Negative & Predicted Positive  \\ \hline \hline  
        Actual Negative & True Negative (TN) & False Positive (FP) \\ \hline
        Actual Positive & False Negative (FN) & True Positive (TP) \\ \hline 
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Confusion Matrix}
    \label{tab:confmat}
\end{table}

As shown in the table, the columns are predicted class and the rows are actual class. \\
Over a dataset of finite samples, the count of correctly classified negative samples is termed as True Negative (TN), while the count of incorrectly classified negative samples is termed as False Positive (FP).\\
Similarly, the count of incorrectly classified positive sample is termed as False Negative (FN), while the count of correctly classified positive sample is termed as True Positive (TP).

For any classification task, predictive accuracy is defined as the total number of correctly classified samples over total number of samples. \\
Mathematically, it is given by, $$ Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TN + FP + FN + TP}$$
In machine learning, we evaluate the performance of a classifier by its error rate which is given by, $$Error Rate = 1 - Accuracy$$
This performance measure works well for balanced class data sets, but for imbalanced datasets a much wider used metric is the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. 

A typically ROC curve is a plot of percentage True Positive vs percentage False Positive. \\
One such curve is shown in Figure \textbf{XX}.\\
We have \%ge FP on the X-axis given by, $$\%ge~FP = \frac{FP}{TN + FP}$$
and \%ge TP on the Y-axis given by, $$\%ge~TP = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$
As evident from the definition, the ideal point on the curve will be (0,100), signifying the all positive examples are classified correctly while no negative samples are classified wrongly as positive.\\
The Area Under the Curve (AUC) can be taken as a good metric for comparing different classifiers, but these can be suboptimal for some specific cost and class distributions.\\
Thus, the convex hull of ROC curve, being potentially optimal, is also taken as one of the performance metrics.
